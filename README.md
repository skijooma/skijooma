### Hi there 👋 :sunglasses: 
- 🔭 I currently work with [WiredIn Ltd.](https://www.wiredin.rw/). I work on a couple of projects for the company's offshore clients, in addition to in-house work.
- The tech stack that work with is fundamentally hinged on [Android](https://www.android.com/) & [React Native](https://www.android.com/), overreaching domains such as web development, UI/UX, & productivity infrastructure, among others.
