- The tech stack that I work with is fundamentally hinged on [Android](https://www.android.com/) & [React Native](https://www.android.com/), overreaching domains such as web development, UI/UX, & productivity infrastructure, among others.
- I speak Luganda, English, and basic - intermediate Kinyarwanda/German. :) Ich verbessere meine Deutschkenntnisse auf C1 (Es ist Zeit)
- Entrepreneurship is part of the year's goals.. (Es ist Zeit)
